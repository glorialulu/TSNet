TSNet is a Python package designed to perform transient simulation in water
distribution networks. The software includes capability to:

* Create transient models based on EPANET INP files
* Operate valves and pumps
* Add disruptive events including pipe bursts and leaks
* Perform transient simulation using Method of characteristics (MOC) techniques
* Visualize results
